"""Paint the pistol glb's parts and regenerate assets/pistol.vec.

The source model (a sci-fi water pistol) ships as a single untextured
0.8-grey material, so the converted strokes come out pure white. It does
carry eight named part meshes, though — so instead of hand-classifying
edges in the .vec, this patches one material per part into the glb
(emissive cyan for the tank windows, tinted metals for the body, per the
maintainer's reference render) and lets vex-convert's normal rules do
the rest: emissive×strength → HDR stroke color, baseColor otherwise.

    python3 tools/paint_pistol.py [source.glb]   # default: assets/pistol.glb

Idempotent — it rewrites the materials array, so re-running on the
already-painted glb is the retuning loop: edit PARTS below, rerun,
look at a screenshot.

Full regeneration from the pristine high-poly source
(`assets/pistol_full.glb`, 122k tris) goes through decimation first —
the full mesh is far too dense for a stroke viewmodel (see
decimate_glb.py; needs a python with fast-simplification):

    python tools/decimate_glb.py assets/pistol_full.glb /tmp/dec.glb 0.70
    python3 tools/paint_pistol.py /tmp/dec.glb

0.70 is the tuned reduction: deeper (0.82) turns the tank's screw
circles into hexagons and leaves stray crease lines across flat faces.
